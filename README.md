# BNN-methods

Hello. This is going to be the repository of the code and guides related to the work done on my master's thesis in Advanced Robotics technology from SDU. It will be empty until around 5-6 (now moved to the 13th as I am no longer home) in January and slowly be worked on.

TODO Next:

Data dump of code

The overall timeline for ideas

Start Guides

Provided example code

Future:

Clean Code

Clean Appendix

Improve code

Optomise code

Add to the code base.


FUTURE Future:
I will start reworking some of the code and forgotten code bases I found in my journey. I did not have time to explore them and who knows what else.
