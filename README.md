# BNN-methods

Hello. This is going to be the repository of the code and guides related to the work done on my master's thesis in Advanced Robotics technology from SDU. It will be empty until around 5-6 January and slowly be worked on.

TODO Next:
Data dump of code
The overall timeline for ideas
Start Guides
Provided example code
Future:
Clean Code
Clean Appendix
Improve code
Optomise code
Add to the code base.

FUTURE Future:
I will start reworking some of the code and forgotten code bases I found in my journey. I did not have time to explore them and who knows what else.
